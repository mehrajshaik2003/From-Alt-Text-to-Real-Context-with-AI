# From-Alt-Text-to-Real-Context-with-AI
This project enhances digital accessibility by using AI to surpass basic alt text, generating richer, context-aware image descriptions. By integrating deep learning and semantic analysis, it not only identifies image content but also interprets its meaning within context, ensuring deeper understanding and improved usability for diverse users.
Objectives:
Enhance Digital Accessibility – Improve content comprehension for visually impaired users.
Generate Context-Aware Descriptions – Move beyond basic alt text to provide meaningful, AI-driven image captions.
Integrate Advanced AI Models – Utilize deep learning and semantic analysis for more accurate descriptions.
Ensure Seamless User Experience – Develop a user-friendly interface using Flask (backend) and React.js (frontend).
Efficient Data Storage & Retrieval – Store user uploads and AI-generated captions in an Oracle database.
Advantages:
✔ Improved Accessibility – Provides richer, more informative image descriptions for visually impaired users.
✔ Contextual Understanding – AI-driven captions ensure better integration with surrounding content.
✔ Automation & Efficiency – Reduces manual effort in writing alt text while improving accuracy.
✔ Scalability – Can be expanded to support multiple languages and platforms.
✔ User-Friendly Interface – A smooth, interactive experience for users uploading and retrieving images.
